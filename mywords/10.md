有一个律法师，起来试探耶稣说，夫子，我该作什么才可以承受永生。\\
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

耶稣对他说，律法上写的是什么。你念的是怎样呢。\\
He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

他回答说，你要尽心，尽性，尽力，尽意，爱主你的神。又要爱邻舍如同自己。\\
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

耶稣说，你回答的是。你这样行，就必得永生。\\
And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

那人要显明自己有理，就对耶稣说，**谁是我的邻舍呢**。\\
But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

耶稣回答说，有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去，落在强盗手中，他们剥去他的衣裳，把他打个半死，就丢下他走了。\\
And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

偶然有一个祭司，从这条路下来。看见他就从那边过去了。\\
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

又有一个利末人，来到这地方，看见他，也照样从那边过去了。\\
And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

惟有一个撒玛利亚人，行路来到那里。看见他就动了慈心，\\
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处，包裹好了，扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他。\\
And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

第二天拿出二钱银子来，交给店主说，你且照应他。此外所费用的，我回来必还你。\\
And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

你想这三个人，那一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢。\\
Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?

他说，**是怜悯他的**。耶稣说，你去照样行吧。\\
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
